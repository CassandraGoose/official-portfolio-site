    <p>Our app shines a light on web development culture by creating a fun interactive iOS game. Players have to keep the little developer alive by drinking beer, playing ping pong and making him code. Drag and drop the relevant icons onto the little dev to keep him alive. Keep up because the levels increase with time!</p>
